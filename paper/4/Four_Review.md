####ii. Keywords

**ii1. Event Flow model** : The Event-flow model represents the all possible sequences of events and iteractions that can be executed by on a Graphical User Interface. This is similar to the the data-flow model which represents all the possible definitions and uses of a memory location.

**ii2. Event Flow graph** : It shows all the possible event executions paths with each vertix representing the event and the
edge showing the transition of one event to another.

**ii3. Integration Tree** : A modal dialogue is one when a user at all times during interation with GUI, the interaction of events fall in one modal dialogue. An Integration tree idetifies the realtions between different modal dialogues. It is constructed  once all the modal dialogues were represented as event-flow graphs.

**ii4. Test-Oracles** :  A test oracle is a mechanicsm that determines whether a piece of software executed correctly for a 
test case. In testing, the actual output is compared with a presumably correct expected output. A test oracle may be manual or automated.

**ii5. Model Checking** : A quality assurance activity commonly used to check the correctness of the model. ***Errors*** which
are the correctness problems are discovered during the model checking, help fixing the parameters in the model such as 
operators. In the context, model checking involves whether a model allow certain invalid state to be reached from a known
valid state.

**ii6. Event-Space exploration strategy** : The ESESs use the event-flow model  in a number of ways to develop an end-to-end
GUI testing process. These strategies address more complex problems faced during the model based checking.
