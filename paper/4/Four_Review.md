####ii. Keywords

**ii1. Evnet Flow model** : The Event-flow model represents the all possible sequences of events and iteractions that can be executed by on a Graphical User Interface. This is similar to the the data-flow model which represents all the possible definitions and uses of a memory location.

**ii2. Event Flow graph** : 

**ii3. Integration Tree** : 

**ii4. Test-Oracles** : 

**ii5. Model Checking** : 

**ii6. Event-Space exploration strategy** : The ESESs use the event-flow model  in a number of ways to develop an end-to-end
GUI testing process. These strategies address more complex problems faced during the model based checking.
