**ii1. Adaptive Random Testing** : 

**ii2. Test Case generation** : 

**ii3. Black Box View** : of a mobile application is an approach which looks at the apps by observing input and output data. The input could be user-based such as text,touch input, or context-based such as GPS information,sensors,activity by the chat window,etc.The app generates multiple possibilities of output like graphics,audio,vibration,etc based on the combinations of the changing input sequence.
