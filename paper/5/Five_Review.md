####ii. Keywords

**ii1. Reliability** : 

**ii2. Test automation** : 

**ii3. Empirical bug studies** : The bug recording study of the most popular and most diversely used mobile apps since the 
       Andriod OS came into exitence. The studies are focused on the apps which have a long life time, a detailed bug history
       reported by the developers and users. The reports should consist of broad range of representative bugs.

**ii4. Tracing** : Tracing is the processo f loggin the details of each test case into a trace file. In this paper, the tracing
       activity is carried out while the application is tested against the test cases in the Virtual Machine.Tracing captures 
       three kinds of events: Graphical User Interface (GUI) based, method calls and exceptions.


####iii. Artifacts

**iii1. Motivation** : 
 
**iii2. Checklists:** : 

- [x] ***Construction of the event-flow graphs and integration tree:*** 

- [x] ***Partially create operators from the event-flow graphs:*** 
      
- [x] ***Reverse-Engineering:***

####iv. Scope for Improvement

**ii1. Scalability** : 

**ii2. Reduce space via Abstraction** : 

**ii3. More path traversal** :
