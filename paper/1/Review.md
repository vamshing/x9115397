## (ii)Keywords:
######(ii1)Testing Tools:
The purpose of a testing tool is to run a piece of softwares through a suite of testcases for the purpose of discovering flaws in the design or bugs in the code.
The testing tool being discussed in the paper is *AndroidRipper*.
######(ii2)Android:
Android is an Operating System(OS) developed by Google primarily for touchscreen mobile devices. 
######(ii3)Testing Automation:
The process of using a software to conduct the execution of a suite of test cases on another software is called test automation. The testing software also compares the actual outcomes of a test case with the predicted outcomes.
######(ii4)GUI:
A graphical user interface(GUI), is an interface that allows users to interact 
with electronic devices through graphical icons instead of typed commands. In the paper we will be dealing with GUIs of Android applications.
