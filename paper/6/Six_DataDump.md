## Data Dump - Six

**Dumped :** No.Could not find any in the first five papers reviewed so far

**Reason :** All the papers reviewd so far focused on the tools, and techniques in the area of Automated Testing of mobile applications. There are resouces of the algorithms, and the implemented tools to test them like Moneky,GUI Ripper,etc in the repos. Howvever, no experimental data was released, but it was only mentioned briefly in the papers.
