####ii. Keywords

**ii1. Finite State Machines** : It is a model of mathematical computation, operates by abstraction to solve problems. A FSM has finite number of states, and it can be in only one of the defined states at a point of time.A Finite State Machine is defined by the lists of its states and the triggering condition for transition between the states. Simple examples include traffic lights system, which changes stated based on the number of vehicles, sequential logic circuits, lock and key, etc. An FSM is limited on memory and tasks, and hence, has lesser computational power due to limited states.

**ii2. Abstraction** : Abstraction is the way to handle complexity(***of computation here***). It works by assigning the user, a level of complexity, hiding complex systems under the hood. For instance, the programmer would'nt be interested in the underneath binary operation which takes place while he/she tries to manipulate numbers in a program. These details are hidden from the user, by simply leaving with the features which the user can work with.

**ii3. Rich Internet Application(RIA)** : The RIA's are more dynamic and are more interactive in nature compared to traditional web application. This is enabled by Ajax, a technique which allows the browser to interact with the server without refreshing the page, thereby provding smoother and a dynamic interface to the end-user. An RIA can be considered a single-page model, where changes can be made to page components without needing to refresh it.

**ii4. Document Object Model(DOM) Interface** : DOM is a platform-based and language-neutral programming interface which presents the logical structure of the documents to be accessed and manipulated by the programs and scripts. This way, the content,structure and style of the Documents(***HTML and XML pages***) can be accessed and updated. The documents can be further processed and can be presented back into the existing page.
